  <h1> World Environment Day is celebrated annually on 5 June and is the United Nations' principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the protection of the environment
    
  </h1>

  <h2> In 2020, the theme was biodiversity – a concern that is both urgent and existential. Recent events, from bushfires in Brazil, the United States and Australia to locust infestations across East Africa–and now, coronavirus pandemic – demonstrate the interdependence of humans and the webs of life in which they exist.  
    
  </h2>
  
  <h3> The day was first observed in 1974 in the city of Spokane in the USA.
    
  </h3>
 
     <h4> The day is celebrated by engaging governments, businesses, celebrities and citizens to focus their efforts on a pressing environmental issue.
       
     </h4>
     
       <h5> Every World Environment Day is hosted by a different country, in which official celebrations take place. In 2020, the host was Colombia in partnership with Germany.
